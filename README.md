## Deployment

This project is deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Automated Code Formatting

We use `Prettier` to automatically format the JavaScript code in this project. This ensures consistent code style and readability across the entire codebase.

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions are used to automate the deployment process. Any changes pushed to the `main` branch trigger a workflow that builds and deploys the project to GitHub Pages.

We used two workflows one for formatting `format.yml` & `static.yml`

`format.yml` - To automatically format our code using prettier
`static.yml` - to deploy our website using GitHub pages.

Both the workflows can be achieved in a same file but I separated it in order to make it more readble and for people to understand easily.
